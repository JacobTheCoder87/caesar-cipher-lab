# caesar-cipher-lab
Encrypting messages with Caesar's Cipher

In this lab I had to program a code that will help to encode and decode a message when providing a word and a numeric key

The most challenging part of this lab was figuring out how to design a barrier which will keep the ASCII numbers
within the range of the letters that I wish to encode. In my case it was lowercase a-z which was ASCII numbers 97 - 123. I created this barrier using a for loop with a built in if and else statement. 

The principal of the code was programmed. In the future if I wish to take this project further I could also add in more ASCII values, special characters and maybe even different languages. Overall this lab was very enjoyable and fun!
